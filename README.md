# Overview

I built this as a final project for my Web Full Stack course. It is built on Angular, a Express/Node server and a MongoDB database. I used Bootstrap version 3 for the styling. This was one of the first few times I had used Bootstrap, and I liked it well enough. The sort by rating button floating outside the box is something I want to change, but at the time of completion it looks and functions well enough.
